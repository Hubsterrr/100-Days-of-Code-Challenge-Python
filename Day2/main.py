#################### DAY 2 PROJECT - TIP CALCULATOR ########################

#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.

#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
bill = float(input("What was the total bill?"))
tip = float(input("How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15?")) / 100
group_Size = float(input("How many people to split the bill?"))

to_Pay = (bill / group_Size) * (tip + 1)
print(f"Each person should pay: ${round(to_Pay, 2)}")
